You must push first pass followed
by second pass 
to get anything to run.

Currently supports
global integer variables.
(Addressed and or declared by
standard labels/identifiers.)

(load and save/store from 

Goto and goto_if
and set jump labels.

Arithmetic stack and most
standard arithmetic and
logical and comparison operators.

Print literal string followed
by number.

is it turing complete??

Think it is in theory.

I know it doesnt support arrays,

but you can

if(x==0) use var0
if(x==1) use var1
if(x==2) use var2
if(x==3) use var3

if(x==4) use var4
if(x==5) use var5

which should keep
the theorists happy.
